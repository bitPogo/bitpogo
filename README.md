## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Berlin-based software engineer who loves to do Kotlin (especially Multiplatform) or play with Rust from time to time.
While my profile says "Mobile" my heart beats for Backend and my passion is open source!
You can chat with me also about TDD which I have been doing now for over 5 years or any other XTreme practice.
